For comprehensive documentation, please refer to the PDF manual which is available from http://surpass.rubyforge.org or in the root directory of the source code repository.

If you like to learn from playing with working examples, then there are plenty in the examples/ and webby/examples directories of the source code.

== REQUIREMENTS:

Tested with Ruby 1.8.6 (MRI or JRuby)

This is just standard Ruby, so please feel free to try on other Ruby platforms and let me know how it goes.
