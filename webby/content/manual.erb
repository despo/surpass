\section{Hello World}

Let's do a minimal "Hello World" script. We'll need to take care of any imports, initialize a Workbook object, create a Worksheet within the workbook, then write some text. Here's how.

\subsection{Surpass}

<%= lidio("examples/hello-world.rb")%>

\subsection{XLWT}
<%= lidio("examples/hello-world.py")%>

\subsection{Result}

And, here's how it looks.

\section{Formatting}

The StyleFormat class is a wrapper for the various types of formatting you can apply to a cell. StyleFormat has attributes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item number\_format\_string
  \item font
  \item alignment
  \item borders
  \item pattern
  \item protection
\end{itemize}

Each of these attributes has a corresponding class, and you can look in lib/formatting.rb for the source.

There are two basic ways to set formatting options. You can pass a hash with formatting options when you initialize a new StyleFormat instance, or you can set individual attributes of the formatting classes. You can combine both approaches. Both of these are demonstrated in the next section.

<%= Borders.line_type_directives.to_itemize %>

\subsection{Surpass}
<%= lidio("examples/formatting.rb")%>

And, here's how it looks.
