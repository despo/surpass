Homepage of the Surpass project. Surpass is software for creating Excel spreadsheets in pure native Ruby. Surpass is currently on version <%= Surpass::VERSION %> and is not yet ready for production use, however there are plenty of working examples for those who can't wait for a more stable 0.1.0 release.

Surpass can be installed via Rubygems (gem install surpass), but it is recommended instead to check out the source as this contains documentation and examples:

@bzr branch http://ananelson.com/code/surpass@

You'll need "bazaar":http://bazaar-vcs.org, of course.

Download the "manual":surpass-manual-<%= Surpass::VERSION.gsub(".", "-") %>.pdf
