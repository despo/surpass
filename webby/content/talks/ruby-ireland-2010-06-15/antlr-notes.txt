What is ANTLR?
Parser Generator
ANother Tool for Language Recognition

What would you use it for?
- Domain Specific Languages
- When a regular expression gets too complicated
- When you need really robust code
- Learning more about computer science

vs. Ragel
- Ragel better for state-machine type uses
- ANTLR has recursion - *very* powerful and used in Excel parser
- For many parsing tasks either will work, should try both and see which fits

Targets
- native Ruby: new target
- Java: very well tested, the 'default' target for ANTLR, use via JRuby
- C: For performance/compactness if you don't need JRuby compatibility and you don't mind C
- C# on CLR maybe?

Surpass
- Create Excel spreadsheets using just Ruby - no need to have Microsoft Office or Windows
- We write the .xls files directly
- Microsoft file formats are pretty nasty!
- This is why we need a parser!!
