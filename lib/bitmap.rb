  # Example of a bitmap that covers some of the area from cell A1 to cell B2.
  # 
  # Based on the width and height of the bitmap we need to calculate 8 vars:
  #     col_start, row_start, col_end, row_end, x1, y1, x2, y2.
  # The width and height of the cells are also variable and have to be taken into
  # account.
  # The values of col_start and row_start are passed in from the calling
  # function. The values of col_end and row_end are calculated by subtracting
  # the width and height of the bitmap from the width and height of the
  # underlying cells.
  # The vertices are expressed as a percentage of the underlying cell width as
  # follows (rhs values are in pixels):
  # 
  #        x1 = X / W *1024
  #        y1 = Y / H *256
  #        x2 = (X-1) / W *1024
  #        y2 = (Y-1) / H *256
  # 
  #        Where:  X is distance from the left side of the underlying cell
  #                Y is distance from the top of the underlying cell
  #                W is the width of the cell
  #                H is the height of the cell
  # 
  # Note: the SDK incorrectly states that the height should be expressed as a
  # percentage of 1024.

  # row_start  - Row containing top left corner of object
